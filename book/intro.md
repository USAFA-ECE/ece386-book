## Grading

This course has the following types of assignments:

- **Prelabs** are due *before* the corresponding lab starts
- **In-class exercises (ICE)** are designed to not take much more than one class period
- **Labs** require programming work outside of class as well as a report
- **Daily briefs** are based on the lesson reading or previous lesson content
- **Final project** is cumulative and worth 25% of the grade

## Course Info

> **ECE 386: AI Hardware Applications 3 (1)**
> Students will use Artificial Intelligence pipelines and frameworks to train and deploy machine learning models
> onto various computational platforms. Deployments will consider engineering tradeoffs between model size,
> hardware constraints, and system design grounded in an understanding of computer architecture.
> Students will use Python to implement training on cloud-based hardware accelerators. Inference will be conducted
> on microprocessor and GPU boards. Emphasis will also be placed on the balance of AI provided prediction with
> human provided judgment. Lab. Final project or final exam.
> Prerq: Comp Sci 110; ECE 281 or Comp Sci 351 or department approval. Sem hrs: 3 fall.

### Course Goals

Upon completion of this course, cadets will be able to 1) understand AI as a form of prediction that informs decision-making, 2) design and construct AI training pipelines, 3) deploy AI models on appropriate hardware for inference.​

### Course Objectives

Each objective supports an [ABET Student Outcome](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/accreditation-criteria/criteria-for-accrediting-engineering-programs-2024-2025/) for accreditation.

1. Apply machine prediction to aid in making risk-based decisions in an uncertain or adversarial environment.​
    - #4 – Professional and ethical responsibilities; judgements considering societal factors​
2. Design and construct a machine learning training pipeline using contemporary frameworks and tools.​
    - #1 – Solve complex engr problems by applying engr, science, and math​
3. Evaluate the engineering tradeoffs between devices when deploying models for inference.​
    - #6 - Develop and conduct experiments; analyze data; draw conclusions​
4. Demonstrate the impact of computer architecture on AI computation.​
    - #2 – Engr Design to meet needs while considering societal factors​

#### Prerequisites

- CompSci 110 (for Python programming)
- ECE 281 or CompSci 351 or department approval (for computer architecture, ALU, datapaths)
