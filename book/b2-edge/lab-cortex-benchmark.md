# Lab: Cortex DSP Benchmark

## Pre-reading

Skim *The Designer's Guide to the Cortex-M Processor, 3rd Edition*, by Trevor Martin, [Chapter 9: Practical DSP for Cortex-M Microcontrollers](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-designers-guide/9780323854955/xhtml/Ch009_313-353_B9780323854948000103.xhtml). Pay special attention to the conceptual pieces of each subsection, but don't worry about the exercises.

## Lab

Run the following code on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.

Then write a technical explanation explaining what is going on.
Submit the report on Gradescope.

### Further guidance

- Your report should be well-written and highly technical, but take the tone of an executive summary.
- You can use or not use section headings to facilitate the flow, as you see fit.
- Assume your reader is a computer engineer who is familiar with Arduino, computer architecture, and dot products but has not run this particular benchmark.
- Your references need to be comprised of reputable sources, such as text books and ARM documentation.
- Include quantitative analysis of the results of the code run.
- Spend that majority of your effort explaining those results from a hardware and software standpoint.
- Conclude with a discussion of why this matters and how it may impact edge inference deployments.
- Do not exceed 3 pages.
- Ensure you include a Documentation statement.
