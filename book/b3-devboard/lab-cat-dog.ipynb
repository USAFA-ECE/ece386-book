    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "```{contents}\n",
    ":local:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transfer learning** consists of taking features learned on one problem, and\n",
    "leveraging them on a new, similar problem. For instance, features from a model that has\n",
    "learned to identify racoons may be useful to kick-start a model meant to identify tanukis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is usually done for tasks where your dataset has too little data to train a full-scale model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common incarnation of transfer learning in the context of deep learning is the following workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take layers from a previously trained model.\n",
    "2. Freeze them, so as to avoid destroying any of the information they contain during future training rounds.\n",
    "3. Add some new, trainable layers on top of the frozen layers.\n",
    "    They will learn to turn the old features into predictions on a  new dataset.\n",
    "4. Train the new layers on your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A last, optional step, is **fine-tuning**, which consists of unfreezing the entire\n",
    "model you obtained above (or part of it), and re-training it on the new data with a\n",
    "very low learning rate. This can potentially achieve meaningful improvements, by\n",
    "incrementally adapting the pretrained features to the new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will go over the Keras `trainable` API in detail, which underlies most\n",
    "transfer learning & fine-tuning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Freezing layers: understanding the `trainable` attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "Layers & models have three weight attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `weights` is the list of all weights variables of the layer.\n",
    "- `trainable_weights` is the list of those that are meant to be updated (via gradient\n",
    " descent) to minimize the loss during training.\n",
    "- `non_trainable_weights` is the list of those that aren't meant to be trained.\n",
    " Typically they are updated by the model during the forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: the `Dense` layer has 2 trainable weights (kernel & bias)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "layer = keras.layers.Dense(3)\n",
    "layer.build((None, 4))  # Create the weights\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"weights:\", len(layer.weights))\n",
    "print(\"trainable_weights:\", len(layer.trainable_weights))\n",
    "print(\"non_trainable_weights:\", len(layer.non_trainable_weights))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "weights: 2\n",
    "trainable_weights: 2\n",
    "non_trainable_weights: 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "In general, all weights are trainable weights. The only built-in layer that has\n",
    "non-trainable weights is the `BatchNormalization` layer.\n",
    "It uses non-trainable weights to keep track of the mean and variance of its inputs during training.\n",
    "To learn how to use non-trainable weights in your own custom layers, see the\n",
    "[guide to writing new layers from scratch](/guides/making_new_layers_and_models_via_subclassing/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: the `BatchNormalization` layer has 2 trainable weights and 2 non-trainable weights**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "layer = keras.layers.BatchNormalization()\n",
    "layer.build((None, 4))  # Create the weights\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"weights:\", len(layer.weights))\n",
    "print(\"trainable_weights:\", len(layer.trainable_weights))\n",

    "weights: 4\n",
    "trainable_weights: 2\n",
    "non_trainable_weights: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Layers & models also feature a boolean attribute `trainable`. Its value can be changed.\n",
    "Setting `layer.trainable` to `False` moves all the layer's weights from trainable to\n",
    "non-trainable.  This is called \"freezing\" the layer: the state of a frozen layer won't\n",
    "be updated during training (either when training with `fit()` or when training with\n",
    " any custom loop that relies on `trainable_weights` to apply gradient updates).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: setting `trainable` to `False`**\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The typical transfer-learning workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to how a typical transfer learning workflow can be implemented in Keras:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiate a base model and load pre-trained weights into it.\n",
    "2. Freeze all layers in the base model by setting `trainable = False`.\n",
    "3. Create a new model on top of the output of one (or several) layers from the base\n",
    " model.\n",
    "4. Train your new model on your new dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that an alternative, more lightweight workflow could also be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiate a base model and load pre-trained weights into it.\n",
    "2. Run your new dataset through it and record the output of one (or several) layers\n",
    " from the base model. This is called **feature extraction**.\n",
    "3. Use that output as input data for a new, smaller model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key advantage of that second workflow is that you only run the base model once on\n",
    "your data, rather than once per epoch of training. So it's a lot faster & cheaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "An issue with that second workflow, though, is that it doesn't allow you to dynamically\n",
    "modify the input data of your new model during training, which is required when doing\n",
    "data augmentation, for instance. Transfer learning is typically used for tasks when\n",
    "your new dataset has too little data to train a full-scale model from scratch, and in\n",
    "such scenarios data augmentation is very important. So in what follows, we will focus\n",
    "on the first workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the first workflow looks like in Keras:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, instantiate a base model with pre-trained weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "base_model = keras.applications.Xception(\n",
    "    weights='imagenet',  # Load weights pre-trained on ImageNet.\n",
    "    input_shape=(150, 150, 3),\n",
    "    include_top=False)  # Do not include the ImageNet classifier at the top.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, freeze the base model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "base_model.trainable = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new model on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "inputs = keras.Input(shape=(150, 150, 3))\n",
    "# We make sure that the base_model is running in inference mode here,\n",
    "# by passing `training=False`. This is important for fine-tuning, as you will\n",
    "# learn in a few paragraphs.\n",
    "x = base_model(inputs, training=False)\n",
    "# Convert features of shape `base_model.output_shape[1:]` to vectors\n",
    "x = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)\n",
    "# A Dense classifier with a single unit (binary classification)\n",
    "outputs = keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)\n",
    "model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Train the model on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(),\n",
    "              loss=keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True),\n",
    "              metrics=[keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy()])\n",
    "model.fit(new_dataset, epochs=20, callbacks=..., validation_data=...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your model has converged on the new data, you can try to unfreeze all or part of\n",
    "the base model and retrain the whole model end-to-end with a very low learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an optional last step that can potentially give you incremental improvements.\n",
    "It could also potentially lead to quick overfitting -- keep that in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is critical to only do this step *after* the model with frozen layers has been\n",
    "trained to convergence. If you mix randomly-initialized trainable layers with\n",
    "trainable layers that hold pre-trained features, the randomly-initialized layers will\n",
    "cause very large gradient updates during training, which will destroy your pre-trained\n",
    "features.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also critical to use a very low learning rate at this stage, because\n",
    "you are training a much larger model than in the first round of training, on a dataset\n",
    "that is typically very small.\n",
    "As a result, you are at risk of overfitting very quickly if you apply large weight\n",
    "updates. Here, you only want to readapt the pretrained weights in an incremental way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how to implement fine-tuning of the whole base model:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Unfreeze the base model\n",
    "base_model.trainable = True\n",
    "\n",
    "# It's important to recompile your model after you make any changes\n",
    "# to the `trainable` attribute of any inner layer, so that your changes\n",
    "# are take into account\n",
    "model.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(1e-5),  # Very low learning rate\n",
    "              loss=keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True),\n",
    "              metrics=[keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy()])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train end-to-end. Be careful to stop before you overfit!\n",
    "model.fit(new_dataset, epochs=10, callbacks=..., validation_data=...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note about `compile()` and `trainable`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling `compile()` on a model is meant to \"freeze\" the behavior of that model. This\n",
    "implies that the `trainable`\n",
    "attribute values at the time the model is compiled should be preserved throughout the\n",
    "lifetime of that model,\n",
    "until `compile` is called again. Hence, if you change any `trainable` value, make sure\n",
    "to call `compile()` again on your\n",
    "model for your changes to be taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important notes about `BatchNormalization` layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many image models contain `BatchNormalization` layers. That layer is a special case on\n",
    "every imaginable count. Here are a few things to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `BatchNormalization` contains 2 non-trainable weights that get updated during\n",
    "training. These are the variables tracking the mean and variance of the inputs.\n",
    "- When you set `bn_layer.trainable = False`, the `BatchNormalization` layer will run in inference mode, and will not update its mean & variance statistics. This is not the case for other layers in general, as [weight trainability & inference/training modes are two orthogonal concepts](https://keras.io/getting_started/faq/#whats-the-difference-between-the-training-argument-in-call-and-the-trainable-attribute). But the two are tied in the case of the `BatchNormalization` layer.\n",
    "- When you unfreeze a model that contains `BatchNormalization` layers in order to do fine-tuning, you should keep the `BatchNormalization` layers in inference mode by passing `training=False` when calling the base model. Otherwise the updates applied to the non-trainable weights will suddenly destroy what the model has learned.\n",
